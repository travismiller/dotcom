So this is yet another attempt at maintaining a personal website. I've lost
count of the number of times I've been here. Plone, Drupal, Laravel, and more,
have all had their turn.

Today, it is Gutenberg. I'm excited about Rust and no better way to learn a
new language than to dive all in. I've been excited for a while now about static
site generators and the methodology they represent. Gutenberg has been a short
learning curve and I really like it so far!

Another interesting approach that a friend turned me on to, is utility based
CSS. Tailwind CSS has really done it up nicely.

Lastly, Netlify is doing what I've been formulating in my head for a while now.
A Git based implementation for content management. It makes so much sense.
Branches are cheap and deploying review sites to URLs per branch is obvious.
