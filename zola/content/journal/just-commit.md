Today I'm stepping out of my comfort zone and committing to doing lightning talks at [Tulsa Web Devs](https://github.com/tulsawebdevs). After last nights meeting, while others were doing so, I realized that I should also be sharing the things that interest me. Maybe someone else will find something I have to say interesting.

<!-- more -->

This just so happens to coincide with a [campaign](https://about.gitlab.com/2019/02/18/just-commit-launch/) GitLab is pushing which encourages others to make commitments and stick with them.

So, here I am, [committing to these lightning talks](https://gitlab.com/travismiller/blitz/issues?label_name%5B%5D=talk+idea) which may (or may not) include topics that include [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), and [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
