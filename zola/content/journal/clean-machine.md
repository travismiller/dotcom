Recently, I acquired a new laptop for [work](https://www.broco.com/) and took
the opportunity to start with a clean install. No TimeMachine, nor transfer of
home directory. Just starting over with everything I now know, with a goal of
keeping a manual log of everything installed or configured. Two reasons include:
it'll be interesting to know, and, it will encourage slowing down and thinking
through the actual need or the process of installing something.

Starting clean, we're looking at a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014) with
2.5 GHz Intel Core i7 processor and 16 GM of 1600 MHz DDR3 memory. And, 500 GB
SSD, which is really the biggest upgrade from my previous MacBook which had
250 GB.

To start, the logbook will be simple. A simple Markdown file in the home
directory called: `~/logbook.md`. Simply an `<h2>` for each day with a
un-ordered list of actions. Things like "Download & Install Firefox",
"Install homebrew", and "Copy .ssh directory and [add key to agent](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/)".

[Typora](https://typora.io/) has been great for authoring the Markdown file.
