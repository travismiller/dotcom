So this is yet another attempt at maintaining a personal website. I've lost
count of the number of times I've been here. [Plone][Plone], [Drupal][Drupal],
[Laravel][Laravel], and more, have all had their turn. Today, it
is [Gutenberg][Gutenberg].

<!-- more -->

I'm excited about [Rust][Rust] and no better way to learn a new language than to
dive all in. I've been excited for a while now about static site generators and
the methodology they represent. Gutenberg has been a short learning curve and I
really like it so far!

Another interesting approach that a friend turned me on to, is utility based
CSS. [Tailwind CSS][Tailwind CSS] has really done it up nicely.

Lastly, [Netlify][Netlify] is doing what I've been formulating in my head for a
while now. A Git based implementation for content management. It makes so much
sense. Branches are cheap and deploying review sites to URLs per branch
is obvious.
